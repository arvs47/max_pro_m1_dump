omnivision ofilm 16880 in front and omnivision 16885 in back

le eco2 120fps slowmotion recording available in stockrom 
which uses ov16880 as main camera

Lenovo z5 slowmotion capable 120 fps and 60fps for google camera 
sensor ov 16885 

Status >
Added chromatrix lines with more .so libraries in each chromatrix.xml files 
No changes 

edited media_profiles vendor .xml 
as it uses those for media 
and added 60fps and other resolutions result > snap cam shows and video recording with variable frames
but recording not exceeding 30 above shows variable frame rate in media info app 

Next Plan is to bring libraries from already enabled devices such as le eco or mi max and lenovo z5 
le eco uses qcamera its open source but here it uses closed sources 


Need help with some dev who own 6GB ram devices and experieced in Lib files editing and .so file hex editing
